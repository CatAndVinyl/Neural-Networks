# nano-gpt

**nano-gpt** is a lightweight implementation of a simple transformer model designed to generate Shakespearean text. This project is a fun exploration of natural language processing and transformer architecture using a Jupyter Notebook. Feel free to use, modify, and experiment with the code to create your own language generation models.

## Overview

In the "nano-gpt" repository, you'll find a Jupyter Notebook (`nano-gpt.ipynb`) containing a simple implementation of the transformer architecture. The model is trained on a dataset of Shakespearean text to generate similar-sounding language. This project is educational and intended for those interested in understanding the fundamentals of transformers and natural language processing.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `nano-gpt.ipynb`:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook nano-gpt.ipynb
